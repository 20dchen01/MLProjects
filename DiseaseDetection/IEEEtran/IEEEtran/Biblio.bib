abstract = {Ubiquity of portable location-aware devices and popularity of online location-based services, have recently given rise to the collection of datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. The subject of analyzing such data has consequently gained popularity due to numerous opportunities enabled by understanding objects' (people and animals, among others) mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a hidden semi-Markov-based model to understand the behavior of mobile entities. The hierarchical state structure in our model allows capturing spatiotemporal associations in the locational history both at staypoints and on the paths connecting them. We compare the accuracy of our model with a number of other spatiotemporal models using two real datasets. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis on our model to evaluate its robustness in presence of common issues in mobility datasets such as existence of noise and missing values. Results of our experiments show superiority of the proposed scheme compared with the other models.},

@article{Natarajan2007,
abstract = {Recognizing human activity from a stream of sensory observations is important for a number of applications such as surveillance and human-computer interaction. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been proposed as suitable tools for modeling the variations in the observations for the same action and for discriminating among different actions. HMMs have come in wide use for this task but the standard form suffers from several limitations. These include unrealistic models for the duration of a sub-event and not encoding interactions among multiple agents directly. Semi- Markov models and coupled HMMs have been proposed in previous work to handle these issues. We combine these two concepts into a coupled Hidden semi-Markov Model (CHSMM). CHSMMs pose huge computational complexity challenges. We present efficient algorithms for learning and decoding in such structures and demonstrate their utility by experiments with synthetic and real data.},

@article{Yang2015,
abstract = {Research on building occupancy modeling is becoming increasingly important and prevalent, as occupancy is closely related to building energy efficiency, lighting control, security monitoring, emergency evacuation, and rescue operations. Building occupancy is time-sequenced occupancy changes that represent how occupants occupy a building, including both occupant presence and occupant number. Extensive research has been carried out to model building occupancy based on ambient sensing. However, occupancy models reported in previous work are mostly used to detect and estimate the occupancy in the same spaces, where the models are trained, and the generalizability of existing occupancy models to different spaces has not been explored. In general, collecting precise and continuous occupancy data for each space for training can be time consuming and intrusive. In most cases, it might not be realistic to have access to actual occupancy for all of the spaces in a building, thus it is difficult to establish an individual model for each space and improve large-scale occupancy awareness at the building level. We present a systematic framework for cross-space occupancy modeling through non-intrusive ambient sensing and relationship learning, by which the model was trained in one space and then applied to other geometrically similar spaces. Six rooms in two buildings were selected to validate the effectiveness of the framework. It was found that daily F-measure ranged from 0.71 to 0.94 with the mean of 0.80, and daily RMSE ranged from 0.42 to 1.72 with the mean of 1.23 for all classes of occupancy. Daily occupied/unoccupied detection accuracy ranged from 0.79 to 0.99 with the mean of 0.91; and the daily number estimation accuracy ranged from 0.63 to 0.78 with the mean of 0.71, when only the occupied periods were considered. The results showed that the F-measure and daily RMSE had an approximately negative linear relationship while the daily occupied/unoccupied detection accuracy had an approximately positive logarithmic relationship with the daily number estimation accuracy. Three potential influential factors on cross-modeling performance were also investigated. It was found that the level of real-time occupancy variation, the degree of long-term occupancy difference between spaces, and the operation of HVAC systems had negatively logarithmic, linear, and logistic relations with the daily cross-space occupancy modeling accuracies, respectively.},

@article{Lim2015,
abstract = {Energy consumption in commercial and educational buildings is impacted by group activities such as meetings, workshops, classes and exams, and can be reduced by scheduling these activities to take place at times and locations that are favorable from an energy standpoint. This paper improves on the effectiveness of energy-aware room-booking and occupancy scheduling approaches, by allowing the scheduling decisions to rely on an explicit model of the building's occupancy-based HVAC control. The core component of our approach is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which optimally solves the joint occupancy scheduling and occupancy-based HVAC control problem. To scale up to realistic problem sizes, we embed this MILP model into a large neighborhood search (LNS). We obtain substantial energy reduction in comparison with occupancy-based HVAC control using arbitrary schedules or using schedules obtained by existing heuristic energy-aware scheduling approaches.},

@article{Johnson2010,
abstract = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the traditional HMM. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi- Markovianity, which has been developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.},
