	Abstract = {The commercial building sector has become the focus of many governmental energy reduction initiatives to achieve more sustainable development. Reducing building energy use starts by improving the design of buildings. To this end, energy modeling and simulation tools are used during the design phase to predict energy use and help designers choose and size the different building systems. Large discrepancies are however being observed between predicted and actual building energy performances. In order to determine the sources of errors and improve these predictions, the sensitivity of energy models to different input parameters needs to be evaluated. Studies in literature have extensively evaluated the sensitivity of models to the buildings' technical design parameters. However, none considered the parameters related to the energy consumption behavior of occupants, leaving their impact on energy modeling unknown. This paper presents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis study performed on the occupancy behavioral parameters of typical office buildings of different size and in different weather zones. Significant sensitivity levels were observed, varying according to both building size and weather conditions.

	Abstract = {Ubiquity of portable location-aware devices and popularity of online location-based services, have recently given rise to the collection of datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. The subject of analyzing such data has consequently gained popularity due to numerous opportunities enabled by understanding objects' (people and animals, among others) mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a hidden semi-Markov-based model to understand the behavior of mobile entities. The hierarchical state structure in our model allows capturing spatiotemporal associations in the locational history both at staypoints and on the paths connecting them. We compare the accuracy of our model with a number of other spatiotemporal models using two real datasets. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis on our model to evaluate its robustness in presence of common issues in mobility datasets such as existence of noise and missing values. Results of our experiments show superiority of the proposed scheme compared with the other models.},

	Abstract = {Climate change and the urgency of decarbonizing the built environment are driving technological innovation in the way we deliver thermal comfort to occupants. These changes, in turn, seem to be setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research. This article presents a literature review of major changes, developments, and trends in the field of thermal comfort research over the last 20 years. One of the main paradigm shift was the fundamental conceptual reorientation that has taken place in thermal comfort thinking over the last 20 years; a shift away from the physically based determinism of Fanger's comfort model toward the mainstream and acceptance of the adaptive comfort model. Another noticeable shift has been from the undesirable toward the desirable qualities of air movement. Additionally, sophisticated models covering the physics and physiology of the human body were developed, driven by the continuous challenge to model thermal comfort at the same anatomical resolution and to combine these localized signals into a coherent, global thermal perception. Finally, the demand for ever increasing building energy efficiency is pushing technological innovation in the way we deliver comfortable indoor environments. These trends, in turn, continue setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research for the next decades.},

	Abstract = {Climate change and the urgency of decarbonizing the built environment are driving technological innovation in the way we deliver thermal comfort to occupants. These changes, in turn, seem to be setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research. This article presents a literature review of major changes, developments, and trends in the field of thermal comfort research over the last 20 years. One of the main paradigm shift was the fundamental conceptual reorientation that has taken place in thermal comfort thinking over the last 20 years; a shift away from the physically based determinism of Fanger's comfort model toward the mainstream and acceptance of the adaptive comfort model. Another noticeable shift has been from the undesirable toward the desirable qualities of air movement. Additionally, sophisticated models covering the physics and physiology of the human body were developed, driven by the continuous challenge to model thermal comfort at the same anatomical resolution and to combine these localized signals into a coherent, global thermal perception. Finally, the demand for ever increasing building energy efficiency is pushing technological innovation in the way we deliver comfortable indoor environments. These trends, in turn, continue setting the directions for contemporary thermal comfort research for the next decades.},

	Abstract = {The ability to learn and recognize human activities of daily living (ADLs) is important in building pervasive and smart environments. In this paper, we tackle this problem using the hidden semi-Markov model. We discuss the state-of-the-art duration modeling choices and then address a large class of exponential family distributions to model state durations. Inference and learning are efficiently addressed by providing a graphical representation for the model in terms of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). We investigate both discrete and continuous distributions from the exponential family (Poisson and inverse Gaussian respectively) for the problem of learning and recognizing ADLs. A full comparison between the exponential family duration models and other existing models including the traditional multinomial and the new Coxian are also presented. Our work thus completes a thorough investigation into the aspect of duration modeling and its application to human activities recognition in a real-world smart home surveillance scenario},

Based on the shape and motion properties of these objects, we infer probabilities of primitive events frame-by-frame by using Bayesian networks. Composite events, consisting of multiple primitive events, over extended periods of time are analyzed by using a hidden, semi-Markov finite state model. This results in more reliable event segmentation compared to the use of standard HMMs in noisy video sequences at the cost of some increase in computational complexity. We describe our approach to reducing this complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using both real-world and perturbed data.},

A single-thread action is represented by a stochastic finite automaton of event states, which are recognized from the characteristics of the trajectory and shape of moving blob of the actor using Bayesian methods. A multi-agent event is composed of several action threads related by temporal constraints.

	Abstract = {Thermal comfort is the main driving factor in determining heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems' operational settings. Current building management systems (BMS) operate according to conservatively defined and standardized settings. Many dynamic environmental and human related variables affect occupant thermal comfort in buildings, calling for flexibility in HVAC operations by integrating dynamic user preferences. This paper builds on the vision that a participatory sensing based approach could be used for integrating user thermal comfort preferences into the operational logic of HVAC systems on a real time and continuous basis. The paper emphasizes on participatory sensing requirements for improving human data acquisition by proposing a thermal comfort preference scale. Several guiding features, which could potentially improve the users' expressions of thermal comfort preferences, were evaluated. Interface usability evaluation methods, including think aloud usability assessment studies and task execution surveys, were used in order to assess the proposed alternatives. Moreover, a field experiment was conducted to explore the driving factors, which affect users' thermal preference vote, for determining HVAC control parameters. The results showed that the proposed sensation scale outperforms a five-level ASHRAE like scale and the addition of the guiding features helps increase the consistency between users' expectations and their votes. The results of the field study showed that the ambient temperature is the most effective factor on users' votes. Consequently, HVAC set points for temperature could be used as a control parameter for personalized thermal comfort without any need for retrofitting HVAC system components.},

	Abstract = {There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the traditional HMM. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi- Markovianity, which has been developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce an adaptive fuzzy neural network framework for classification of data stream using a partially supervised learning algorithm. The framework consists of an evolving granular neural network capable of processing nonstationary data streams using a one-pass incremental algorithm. The granular neural network evolves fuzzy hyperboxes and uses nullnorm based neurons to classify data. The learning algorithm performs structural and parametric adaptation whenever environment changes are reflected in input data. It needs no prior statistical knowledge about data and classes. Computational experiments show that the fuzzy granular neural network is robust against different types of concept drift, and is able to handle unlabeled examples efficiently.},

	Abstract = {Building energy management and the necessity to reduce overall energy consumption is becoming an increasingly important topic. Especially in dynamic environments, where the setting and occupancy keep changing, knowing occupancy information, including the number and identities of the occupants and where they are located, can be beneficial in energy management as well as other application areas including safety, security and emergency response. In particular, occupancy information has a direct impact on various aspects of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as heat loads, system running time, required heating, cooling and distribution of conditioned air, and preferred temperature set points. Energy-saving strategies can be carried out in response to real-time occupancy changes. In this paper, an RFID based occupancy detection system is proposed to support demand-driven HVAC operations by detecting and tracking multiple stationary and mobile occupants in multiple spaces simultaneously. The proposed system estimates the thermal zone where each occupant is located, and reports the number of occupants for each thermal zone in real time. The field tests yielded an average zone level detection accuracy of 88{\%} for stationary occupants and 62{\%} for mobile occupants. For scattering analysis, averages distances to corresponding centroids were 1.45m and 3.24m for stationary and mobile occupants, respectively. In order to explore the benefits of demand-driven HVAC operations, current HVAC work procedures are examined, major energy consumers in HVAC systems are identified and quantified, and energy-saving strategies are presented.

	Abstract = {Energy consumption in commercial and educational buildings is impacted by group activities such as meetings, workshops, classes and exams, and can be reduced by scheduling these activities to take place at times and locations that are favorable from an energy standpoint. This paper improves on the effectiveness of energy-aware room-booking and occupancy scheduling approaches, by allowing the scheduling decisions to rely on an explicit model of the building's occupancy-based HVAC control. The core component of our approach is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which optimally solves the joint occupancy scheduling and occupancy-based HVAC control problem. To scale up to realistic problem sizes, we embed this MILP model into a large neighborhood search (LNS). We obtain substantial energy reduction in comparison with occupancy-based HVAC control using arbitrary schedules or using schedules obtained by existing heuristic energy-aware scheduling approaches.},

	Abstract = {Activity recognition is a process by which the ongoing observed behavior of an agent is tracked and mapped to a given model, explaining the behavior and accounting for hidden or unobservable state (e.g., goals or beliefs of the obser ved agents). Various methods for activity recognition exist. A popular family of such methods rely on Hidden Markov Models HMMs and variants for recognition. These models, however, do not account for changes in transition probabilities base d on the duration an agent has spent in a given state. This paper investigates Markov models that go beyond existing models, to explicitly model the dependency of transition probabilities on state duration. In particular, we propose the use of Non-stationary Hidden Semi Markov Models (NHSMMs) in activity recognition. We present the NHSMM model, and compare its performance in recognizing normal and abnormal behavior, using synthetic da ta from an industry simulator. We show that for relatively simple activity recognition tasks, both HSMMs and NHSMMs easily and significantly outperform HMMs. In more complex tasks, the NHSMMs also outperf orm the HSMMs, and allow significantly more accurately recognition.},

	Abstract = {Recognizing human activity from a stream of sensory observations is important for a number of applications such as surveillance and human-computer interaction. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been proposed as suitable tools for modeling the variations in the observations for the same action and for discriminating among different actions. HMMs have come in wide use for this task but the standard form suffers from several limitations. These include unrealistic models for the duration of a sub-event and not encoding interactions among multiple agents directly. Semi- Markov models and coupled HMMs have been proposed in previous work to handle these issues. We combine these two concepts into a coupled Hidden semi-Markov Model (CHSMM). CHSMMs pose huge computational complexity challenges. We present efficient algorithms for learning and decoding in such structures and demonstrate their utility by experiments with synthetic and real data.},

This stardard needs very accurate measurements of the six appropiate input parameters (air temperature, humidity, air velocity, clothing insulation and metabolic rate), but this is unrealistic. Instead of trying to measure comfort though those measurements which is also too generalistic (not every occupant feels the comfort parameters the same way) it seems a good alternative to understand comformt directly from occupant activities and feedback.

The historical data were updated through an exponentially weighted average of estimates at the same time on past similar days. The estimates for a given time on a given day were calculated as weighted averages of all estimates for that time, including estimates from past and future times on that day.

@article{Tapia2004,
	Abstract = {In this work, a system for recognizing activities in the home setting using a set of small and simple state-change sensors is introduced. The sensors are designed to be ``tape on and forget'' devices that can be quickly and ubiquitously installed in home environments. The proposed sensing system presents an alternative to sensors that are sometimes perceived as invasive, such as cameras and microphones. Unlike prior work, the system has been deployed in multiple residential environments with non-researcher occupants. Preliminary results on a small dataset show that it is possible to recognize activities of interest to medical professionals such as toileting, bathing, and grooming with detection accuracies ranging from 25{\%} to 89{\%} depending on the evaluation criteria used.},

	Abstract = {In HMM-based speech synthesis, we have to choose the modeling strategy for speech synthesis units depending on the amount of avail- able speech data to generate synthetic speech of better quality. In general, speaker-dependent modeling is an ideal choice for a large speech data, whereas speaker adaptation with average voice model becomes promising when available speech data of a target speaker is limited. This paper describes several speaker adaptation algorithms and MAP modification to develop consistent method for synthesiz- ing speech in a unified way for arbitrary amount of the speech data. We incorporate these adaptation algorithms into our HSMM-based speech synthesis system and show its effectiveness from results of several evaluation tests.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a statistical approach for model- ing and synthesizing human walking motion. In the ap- proach, each motion primitive is modeled statistically from motion capture data using multiple regression hidden semi- Markov model (HSMM). HSMM is an extension of hidden Markov model (HMM), in which each state has an explicit state duration probability distribution, and multiple regres- sion HSMM is the one whose mean parameter of probabil- ity distribution function is assumed to be given by a func- tion of factors which affects human motion. In this paper, we introduce a training algorithm for the multiple regres- sion HSMM, called factor adaptive training based on the EMalgorithmand also describe a parameter generation al- gorithm from motion primitive HSMMs with prescribed val- ues of factors. From experimental results, we show that the proposed technique can control walking movements in ac- cordance with a change of the factors such as walking pace and stride length and can provide realistic human motion.},

@article{Yang2015,
	Abstract = {Research on building occupancy modeling is becoming increasingly important and prevalent, as occupancy is closely related to building energy efficiency, lighting control, security monitoring, emergency evacuation, and rescue operations. Building occupancy is time-sequenced occupancy changes that represent how occupants occupy a building, including both occupant presence and occupant number. Extensive research has been carried out to model building occupancy based on ambient sensing. However, occupancy models reported in previous work are mostly used to detect and estimate the occupancy in the same spaces, where the models are trained, and the generalizability of existing occupancy models to different spaces has not been explored. In general, collecting precise and continuous occupancy data for each space for training can be time consuming and intrusive. In most cases, it might not be realistic to have access to actual occupancy for all of the spaces in a building, thus it is difficult to establish an individual model for each space and improve large-scale occupancy awareness at the building level. We present a systematic framework for cross-space occupancy modeling through non-intrusive ambient sensing and relationship learning, by which the model was trained in one space and then applied to other geometrically similar spaces. Six rooms in two buildings were selected to validate the effectiveness of the framework. It was found that daily F-measure ranged from 0.71 to 0.94 with the mean of 0.80, and daily RMSE ranged from 0.42 to 1.72 with the mean of 1.23 for all classes of occupancy. Daily occupied/unoccupied detection accuracy ranged from 0.79 to 0.99 with the mean of 0.91; and the daily number estimation accuracy ranged from 0.63 to 0.78 with the mean of 0.71, when only the occupied periods were considered. The results showed that the F-measure and daily RMSE had an approximately negative linear relationship while the daily occupied/unoccupied detection accuracy had an approximately positive logarithmic relationship with the daily number estimation accuracy. Three potential influential factors on cross-modeling performance were also investigated. It was found that the level of real-time occupancy variation, the degree of long-term occupancy difference between spaces, and the operation of HVAC systems had negatively logarithmic, linear, and logistic relations with the daily cross-space occupancy modeling accuracies, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Many sensors have to be used simultaneously for multipoint carbon dioxide (CO(2)) observation. All the sensors should be calibrated in advance, but this is a time-consuming process. To seek a simplified calibration method, we used four commercial CO(2) sensor models and characterized their output tendencies against ambient temperature and length of use, in addition to offset characteristics. We used four samples of standard gas with different CO(2) concentrations (0, 407, 1,110, and 1,810 ppm). The outputs of K30 and AN100 models showed linear relationships with temperature and length of use. Calibration coefficients for sensor models were determined using the data from three individual sensors of the same model to minimize the relative RMS error. When the correction was applied to the sensors, the accuracy of measurements improved significantly in the case of the K30 and AN100 units. In particular, in the case of K30 the relative RMS error decreased from 24{\%} to 4{\%}. Hence, we have chosen K30 for developing a portable CO(2) measurement device (10 × 10 × 15 cm, 900 g). Data of CO(2) concentration, measurement time and location, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure can be recorded onto a Secure Digital (SD) memory card. The CO(2) concentration in a high-school lecture room was monitored with this device. The CO(2) data, when corrected for simultaneously measured temperature, water vapor partial pressure, and atmospheric pressure, showed a good agreement with the data measured by a highly accurate CO(2) analyzer, LI-6262. This indicates that acceptable accuracy can be realized using the calibration method developed in this study.},

	Abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) encompasses a large class of stochastic process models and has been successfully applied to a number of scientific and engineering problems, including speech and other pattern recognition problems, and DNA sequence comparison. A hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is an extension of HMM, designed to remove the constant or geometric distributions of the state durations assumed in HMM. A larger class of practical problems can be appropriately modeled in the setting of HSMM. A major restriction is found, however, in both conventional HMM and HSMM, i.e., it is generally assumed that there exists at least one observation associated with every state that the hidden Markov chain takes on. We will remove this assumption and consider the following situations: (i) observation data may be missing for some intervals; and (ii) there are multiple observation streams that are not necessarily synchronous to each other and may have different "emission distributions" for the same state. We propose a new and computationally efficient forward-backward algorithm for HSMM with missing observations and multiple observation sequences. The required computational amount for the forward and backward variables is reduced to O(D), where D is the maximum allowed duration in a state. Finally, we will apply the extended HSMM to estimate the mobility model parameters for the Internet service provisioning in wireless networks. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {Human daily activity recognition using mobile personal sensing technology plays a central role in the field of pervasive healthcare. One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements and the variety of styles when people perform a certain activity. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing and sparse representation theory using wearable inertial sensors. Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the training set. The class membership of the activity signal is determined by solving a l(1) minimization problem. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our sparse representation-based approach by recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by 14 subjects. Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of 96.1{\%}, which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machine by as much as 6.7{\%}. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking for ``optimal features'' to achieve the best activity recognition performance is less important within our framework.},

	Abstract = {Climate change and global warming as the main human societies' threats are fundamentally associated with energy consumption and GHG emissions. The residential sector, representing 27{\%} and 17{\%} of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions, respectively, has a considerable role to mitigate global climate change. Ten countries, including China, the US, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Canada, Iran, and the UK, account for two-thirds of global CO2 emissions. Thus, these countries' residential energy consumption and GHG emissions have direct, significant effects on the world environment. The aim of this paper is to review the status and current trends of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and energy policies in the residential sector, both globally and in those ten countries. It was found that global residential energy consumption grew by 14{\%} from 2000 to 2011. Most of this increase has occurred in developing countries, where population, urbanization and economic growth have been the main driving factors. Among the ten studied countries, all of the developed ones have shown a promising trend of reduction in CO2 emissions, apart from the US and Japan, which showed a 4{\%} rise. Globally, the residential energy market is dominated by traditional biomass (40{\%} of the total) followed by electricity (21{\%}) and natural gas (20{\%}), but the total proportion of fossil fuels has decreased over the past decade. Energy policy plays a significant role in controlling energy consumption. Different energy policies, such as building energy codes, incentives, energy labels have been employed by countries. Those policies can be successful if they are enhanced by making them mandatory, targeting net-zero energy building, and increasing public awareness about new technologies. However, developing countries, such as China, India and Iran, still encounter with considerable growth in GHG emissions and energy consumption, which are mostly related to the absence of strong, efficient policy.},

	Abstract = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model (HMM), a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) allows the underlying stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state has variable duration and a number of observations being produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis, human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is presented in this paper, including modelling, inference, estimation, implementation and applications. It first provides a unified description of various HSMMs and discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional models, including the explicit duration, variable transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed. Various duration distributions and observation models are presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used to present results for binary decision problems in machine learning. However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

@article{Candanedo2016,
	abstract = {The accuracy of the prediction of occupancy in an office room using data from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors has been evaluated with different statistical classification models using the open source program R. Three data sets were used in this work, one for training, and two for testing the models considering the office door opened and closed during occupancy. Typically the best accuracies (ranging from 95{\%} to 99{\%}) are obtained from training Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF) models. The results show that a proper selection of features together with an appropriate classification model can have an important impact on the accuracy prediction. Information from the time stamp has been included in the models, and usually it increases the accuracy of the detection. Interestingly, using only one predictor (temperature) the LDA model was able to estimate the occupancy with accuracies of 85{\%} and 83{\%} in the two testing sets.},
